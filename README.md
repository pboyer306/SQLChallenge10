# Installation
Clone this repo or download the zip! Then run npm install. You may need to also do npm install inquirer as well to make this work if it doesn't first try for you. Make sure to set up your .env file as well. My database was called employee_db. If you want to run the seeds file you will need to navigate to the db folder and then enter your PSQL information, create the data base, run the schema.sql then the seeds.sql file.

Run node index.js

TLDR; npm install --> set up .env --> set up postgress and run schema and seeds files

# Usage
Once in your terminal/coding tool (like VSCode) run node index.js to get the prompts.
